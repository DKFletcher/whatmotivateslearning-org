## We are moving!
whatmotivateslearning.com is moving toward a more formal non-profit structure. As part of this effort the website is getting a complete overhaul.

This is where you will find all the code for the new service, and this repo will be the hub. The proposed new features are:

* AWS CloudFormation Services
* Localization surface via react-i18next
* A PWA compliant JAMStack
